When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Collaborating with others; keep a backup; edit from mult. locations

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If you're working on a bug you may want to wait to pull until you're sure it's fixed

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: clone that github makes; can only fork to another location in github
    Clone: copy entire repository
    Branch: add changes in same repository

    Branching: add new changes to a repository while keeping an easy reference to a previous version
    Clone: work on repository locally rather than using the GitHub
    Fork: make changes to repository public, but don't have permission to modify the original

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Can merge changes into own branches offline I can do this even

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Uploading files on dropbox etc.; wouldn't be able to work collaboratively in real time

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    A separate branch could be useful for a very large group of collaborators
